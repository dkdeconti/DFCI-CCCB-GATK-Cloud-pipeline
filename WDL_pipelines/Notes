Docker:
    *Using broadinstitute/java-baseimage as supposedly they've worked
     out java issues with it
    *Can copy over jar files, but must compile objects within the docker,
     or just use apt-get

WDL:
    *Seems to skip over command in runtime that don't make sense given
     the current resource - i.e. invocations that make sense on the cloud
     don't do anything locally, just a warning
        *So I can use this to run the exact same pipeline anywhere,
         and it should just ignore what doesn't make sense (theoretically)
    *cromwell runtime can output a metadata file for output. Use this to
     access the output files as metadata (JSON file)
        ex: java -jar cromwell.jar run <wdl> <inputs> - <outpus.json>
        the '-' skips that file

Cloud:
