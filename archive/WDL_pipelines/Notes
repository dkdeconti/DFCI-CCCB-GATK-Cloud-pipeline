Docker:
    *Using broadinstitute/java-baseimage as supposedly they've worked
     out java issues with it
    *Can copy over jar files, but must compile objects within the docker,
     or just use apt-get
    *Uploading Docker to Google Container Registry:
        *First tag the docker with the required upload info
            *docker tag basic-seq-tools us.gcr.io/dfci-cccb/basic-seq-tools
        *Then upload the docker with gcloud utils
            *gcloud docker -- push us.gcr.io/dfci-cccb/basic-seq-tools

WDL:
    *Seems to skip over command in runtime that don't make sense given
     the current resource - i.e. invocations that make sense on the cloud
     don't do anything locally, just a warning
        *So I can use this to run the exact same pipeline anywhere,
         and it should just ignore what doesn't make sense (theoretically)
    *cromwell runtime can output a metadata file for output. Use this to
     access the output files as metadata (JSON file)
        ex: java -jar cromwell.jar run <wdl> <inputs> - <outpus.json>
        the '-' skips that file

Cloud:
    *Upload to Google Container Registry (gcr.io)
        *e.g. {docker: gcr.io/dfci-cccb/basic-seq-tools
    *Docs:
        *http://gatkforums.broadinstitute.org/gatk/discussion/8646/can-a-biochemist-with-one-python-course-under-her-belt-start-running-analyses-in-the-cloud
        *https://github.com/googlegenomics/pipelines-api-examples/tree/master/wdl_runner
    *Ran into problems moving and copying data. See:
